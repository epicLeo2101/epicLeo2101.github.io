A game that is about my pet dog everyday morning. Your objective is to eat as many food as you can. Depending on your choices, you'll either have eaten everything you could possibly eat or eat absolutely nothing. Here's my code: [Juno's Morning](https://github.com/epicLeo2101/Juno-sMorning)

Before I made my adventure game I had to practice with these little projects to prepare me for the actual game. There projects I did to learn the basics of code and familiar myself to it. So if you're interested they're listed below:

1. [TipCalculator](https://github.com/epicLeo2101/TipCalculator)
2. [WhileLoopMenuDemo](https://github.com/epicLeo2101/WhileLoopMenuDemo)
